A hook that provides that same functionality as the [`<RecoilURLSyncTransit/>`](/docs/api-reference/recoil-sync/RecoilURLSyncTransit) component.  The options for the hook are equivalent to the props of the component.  You can use either the component or the hook form, which is more convenient for you.
