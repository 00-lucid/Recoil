A React component that calls the [`useRecoilSync()`](/docs/api-reference/recoil-sync/useRecoilSync) hook for the [Recoil Sync library](/docs/guides/recoil-sync).  The props of the component are equivalent to the options for the hook.  You can use either the component or hook form, whichever is more convenient for you.
